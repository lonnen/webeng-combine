  <h1>Webeng-combine</h1>
  <p>A series of programming puzzles. Attendees of the WebEng 2014 work week are already signed up.</p>
  <p>You're going to be given a git url. Add it as a remote, and whatever you push to that on whatever branch will be taken as a potential answer. If you submit an executable file with a name that matches a puzzle name it will be subjected to a battery of tests. Multiple answers can be pushed at once, but each run has a global timeout of 10 minutes. It is recommended that you use a seperate branch for each puzzle.</p>
  <p>Use the shebang line to write your answer in something other than bash or binary. Currently we support the following interpreters:</p>
  <code>java       1.6.0_27
ruby       1.9.3
ruby1.8    1.8.7
python     2.7.4
python3    3.3.1
node       0.10.25</code>
  <p>as well as whatever binaries you want to compile against an otherwise stock ubuntu:raring machine. Vendor those and any deps you have before submitting.</p>
