  <p>FizzBuzz is a classic interview question that will help you get the hang of the formats and expectations of the game. Your solution is expected to have the same name as the puzzle, <code>01-fizzbuzz</code> in this case. It will be called with a series of inputs and expected to produce an exact output. Assume the inputs are well formed and use unix line endings.</p>

<h1>Input Specification</h1>

<p>Your program will be called with a single argument, the path to a file. The file will contain ASCII text with a single positive integer and some whitespace. The integer may be padded with whitespace on either side. The file may or may not terminate with a single new line character. An example input file follows:</p>

<pre><code>15
</code></pre>

<h2>Output Specification</h2>

<p>Your program should iterate over all integers, inclusive, from 1 to the number provided in the input. For each integer that is evenly divisible by 3, the program must output the string <code>fizz</code>, followed by a newline. For each integer divisible by 5, the program must output the string <code>buzz</code>, followed by a newline. Integers divisible by both should output <code>fizzbuzz</code>, followed by a newline. Any other integer should output itself, followed by a newline.</p>

<pre><code>1
2
fizz
4
buzz
fizz
7
8
fizz
buzz
11

</code></pre>
